# Hexo: A Static Site Generator Built on Node.js

Hexo is a static site generator developed using Node.js. Compared to Jekyll (RubyGem) and Hugo (GoLang), 

Its template engine primarily focuses on parsing templating languages, so the core difference isnâ€™t significant. 

The key distinctions lie in its larger Chinese-speaking community and available plugin resources.

Additionally, Hexo relies on command-line operations (Cmd) rather than a GUI, making it less beginner-friendly. 

This project serves as a simple Hexo demo to address basic static site needs.

## Environment Requirements

* Hexo version: 5.0+
* Minimum Node.js version: 10.13.0

```
npm install -g hexo-cli // Installation
